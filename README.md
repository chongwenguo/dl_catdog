# Classification for Cats and Dogs

## Classification Problems
1. Binary Classification: cat vs dogs
2. Breed Classification for cats
3. Breed Classification for dogs

## Problem Setup
For each problem, we construct two models:
* Build from Scratch
* Fine-Tune Pre-trained Models

For each model, we experiment it with various data augmentation techniques:
* No augmentation
* Traditional data augmentation techniques
* Data Augmentation with GAN

Sample Experimental Results Table:
|                    | No Augmentation | Augmentation 1 | Augmentation 2 | GAN |
|--------------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|-----|
| Model from Scratch |                 |                |                |     |
| Fine-tuned Model   |                 |                |                |     |
