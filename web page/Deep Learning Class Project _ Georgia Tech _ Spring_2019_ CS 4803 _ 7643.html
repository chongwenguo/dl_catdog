      <h2>Introduction / Background / Motivation</h2>
      
      <h4>Classification Problems and Dataset</h4>
      In this project, three classifiers via images are trained and evaluated, which include binary classification: cat
      vs dogs, breed classification for cats, breed classification for dogs. The project consists of three major stages:
      build models from scratch, fine-tune pre-trained models and data augmentation with GAN.
      The Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset contains 37 categories of pets with roughly 200 images for each class. The images have
      a large variations in scale, pose and lighting. Due to high inter class variability, low intra class variability
      and high pose variability, it is not easy to train and obtain a high accarucy breed-classifier, especially when
      the data volume is limited.
      We would like to use GAN to generate several fake cats and dog images. With generated images, we would like
      to see if they can improve accuracy of classifiers if used as data augmentation and if the classifier can
      correctly classify them.

      <h4>Related Works</h4>
      Fine-grained recognition work has been demonstrated on cats and dogs by O. M. Parkhi, A. Vedaldi, A. Zisserman and
      C. V. Jawahar, which trained 63.48% and 55.68% accuracy breed classification for cats and dogs respectively, which
      improved to 66.07% and 59.18% when the ground truth segmentations are used.

<h4>Do the results make sense? Why or why not? Describe what kind of visualization/analysis you performed in order to verify that your results 1) are correct and 2) explain differences in performance from what was expected (e.g. what appeared in papers). Provide specific claims about why you think your model is or is not doing better, and justify those with qualitative and quantitative experiments (not necessarily just final accuracy numbers, but statistics or other data about what the model is doing).</h4>
